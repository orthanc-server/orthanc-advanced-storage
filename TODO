- add unit test project

TODO_CUSTOM_DATA branch
- add REVISIONS in AttachedFiles + Metadata in SQLite since we change the DB schema
- add revisions and customData in all Database plugins
- refuse to instantiate a PluginStorage3 if a DBv4 is not instantiated !
- handle all TODO_CUSTOM_DATA
- check /attachments/...  routes for path returned
- AdvancedStoragePlugin 
  - show warning if a tag is missing when generating the path from tags (+ option to disable this warning)
  - generate path from tags from resource (CreateAttachment)
  - add an instanceId or parentSeriesId arg in CreateInstance ? 
  - implement a 'legacy' root path to group all files with missing tags or path too long
  - avoid error AdvancedStorage - Path to the default storage area should be an absolute path '"OrthancStorage"' when using PG and no StorageDirectory has been defined
  - document that, once you have used the AdvancedStoragePlugin and stored DICOM files, you can not downgrade Orthanc to a previous Orthanc
    without loosing access to the DICOM files
  - write integration test for advanced-storage: 
    - launch 1.12.6
    - upload 1 file
    - launch 1.12.7 with advanced-storage plugin with a non default namingScheme
    - upload 1 file
    - access + delete initial file

- write integration test for transitions from one DB to the other (for each DB plugin):
  - launch 1.11.2, 
  - upload 2 files, 
  - launch 1.12.0, 
  - access + delete one file, 
  - upload one file, 
  - launch 1.11.2 again, 
  - access + delete last 2 files
